This is the Monospace Theme from Google's [IDX](https://idx.dev/). Please note that this is not an official Theme from Google. I just recreated it for VSCode.

2. Search for `IDX Theme` in Extensions
3. Install the theme and choose your variant in `Preferences > Color Theme`
4. Optionally enable the included icon theme in `Preferences > File Icon Theme`
